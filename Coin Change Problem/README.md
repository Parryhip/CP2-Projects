## Author's Info
---
My name is Samuel Andelin, I am in a programming class where I get to code stuff, which is pretty fun. I like to play videogames and like to code as well. I mostly code in Python, but I have coded in some Rust. I definitely prefer python because it is a lot less hassle to be secure, but that is probably more important than it being easy.
